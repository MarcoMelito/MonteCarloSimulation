For it to be fully functional, the file requires three libraries to be installed:
- NumPy to generate the random values for the simulation and the data arrays
- Pandas to generate the .csv output file
- Matplotlib to visualize the results plotted on a graph

Executing the file libraries.py with Python installed will automatically install any missing library.
